Accordion was new thing for me and using javascript with them also very good experience.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
 <div class="accordion">
      <div class="accordion-header" onclick="toggleAccordion(this)">
        <span class="icon"><img src="./assets/images/icon-plus.svg" alt="icon"></span>
        <h5>What is Frontend Mentor, and how will it help me?</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
